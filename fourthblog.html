     The time when I discover about mentally abuse.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I was ten year old I noticed that there was felling throughtout my emotion which I can not explain why do I fell that. The only thing that I could say was: "That is not fair". I was kid at that time still. But I can say that I was conscious at that year. I really liked to isolate myself when I wanted to think deeply of one thing what I saw. I was quiet person I liked to be alone. I have seven siblings but I wasn't the one who is really like to play to another kids.

    <h3>
      History which I have experienced.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have a old sister, she was just fifteen years old whereas I was ten, she has a boyfriend who lived just one kilometer far from our house and he is a rich family's son. By the time they were together, my sister was pregnant, so they had to think of getting married. First, they went to our parents, no need to against their willing anymore because my sister was pregnant, so even our parents wanted to stop them they do not have a choice. they blessed them whereas when they went in the boy's family, his family did not accept they will be together. Do you know why? My sister is from poor family and he is from rich family. This is the sentence which my sister told us that she will never forget : " No matter how much do you love our son, we will never alow him marry such a poor girl like you" said the boy's mother. Can yuo think of how much hurting she may got at that time, The only thing that I can say is it is easy to people to apply a violent mentally if you are nothing. What I mean with nothing here is If you do not have strenght to against a violent in your life, you will be applyed it by someone else often. This is the firs thing which inspired me to think of how much hurting do person get from violent mentally and how does it affect in person's life?, I chalk her situation up to be my experience so I try to not be with rich person no matter how much my desir to be with them, I always keep the distance between us.

      This is just sample story of violent mentally applyed to someone but I think some peoply are applyed by violent mentally but they may not notice that it is violation. It is not that only the case of violent mentality but their are many which person apply them to a person.

      Other story example
    </h3>
    <p>
      When I was in secondary school, I always one of the student on five top when we got result. What I thought was why do student have a different result, You may say because some of student are lazy or some did not revise much or ...., Yes agree that might be the reason but not really the case. Who want to dumb in their life? who want to be embarrassed in fron of their colleague, who want to be the least?  There is some people might be have those willing but not much, and I don not think that will be one of person go to school.
      But what was happened in our school? Teacher only support the students which got good mark, I was one of them but I did not really like it because I was thinking of how about the others especially the one who is least? The teacher should have done opposite of that but why not? This is one of violent mentality, how would the least student fell if no one care of him or here? I was trying to approche the least student at that time so I knew what was they felt, totally depressed. Every word or sentence which they said was sign of person's deepression. I was trying to fell what they felt, I understand her. I pity her but I could not stop her to left the school. Teachers did not care about her, they even giv hurting word to her. So how could she get ride of her unsuccessfulness?
