          Hello!<br>
            I'am Sugi, this is my seconde blog.
            For this time I would like to talk about peer pressure, to expand that, I would like to share with you my litle sister's story.
        <p>
          I have never thought about how bad peer pressure for youth sometimes, but since my litle sister got her husband only at her thirteen age, I believe that there is bad affect of following teenagers's peer.

          My litle sister's story.
        </h3>
        <p>
          When she was studying in secondary school, second years in there, she has got quite many friends. Most of the time she went out with her friends, at that time she was only thirteen years old. In our family, I can say that she was the most rebellious teenagers, even though, she was the most itelligent in our family. She had been answered back our parents often. She did not eat together with us often. she left our house in morning, and she came home in the evening. It was almost every day same as that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seconde semester in her school, she had changed a litle bit. One day, she came early at home, that was unusual for us. She asked our parents to talk to her, she was so solemn. She said that she wanted a blessing from our parents because she asked to married by her boy friend and she wanted to be married,serious written all over her rebellious in her face.That happened because one of her friend had got married and she wated to be too. Our parents did not allow her but she warned them that she will commit suicide If they did not allow her. They did not have any choice, they have to accept it. Now she is ninteen years old she has two childrens. She does not have job, and now she admits that she is totaly lament of what was she has done.
