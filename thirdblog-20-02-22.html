        <p>
          I have lived in Ambohidronono quite a long time, but now I'm studying far from there and only few times a year that I can visit my childhood's village. I can say that it is still a countryside their is no devellopment. For example electricity, road is still bad, etc...

          <b>Marketting</b><br>
            Even though our village is a real countryside, we have place of marketing there. Every thursday, there are a lot of people come in town for marketing which is the center of the village. Most of the people surrounded are usually go there. Even people from capital are going there for gathering a product like banan, beans ...<br>
            Every one who wanted to sell there, they have to built a litle house made by wood or rent the house made by button.

          <b>Transport</b><br>
          It is hard to travel in our village, their is only one car in our village for transport, and it is seldom going to the town. Beside, many people travel for going to the big town, most of the time we try to travel by bicycle.
